### What I learned

hi everyone, in this challenge I continued learning modern and consolidated layout techniques such as the Flexbox, which I used for most of the visual blocks, and the custom properties to speed up the work; For the rest I have not encountered many difficulties.

Any comments or constructive criticisms are welcome, tell me what you think;)
